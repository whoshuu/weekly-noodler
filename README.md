## Hello World

Every week I'll be posting a small exercise here for you to noodle on. These problems vary in difficulty, but are constructed so that the actual coding is trivial compared to the real work, which should be happening in your brain. The week after a problem is posted, I'll post a solution [here](https://github.com/whoshuu/weekly-noodler/tree/master/solutions).

## Got Issues?

If a problem is ambiguous and needs clarification, feel free to open up an [issue](https://github.com/whoshuu/weekly-noodler/issues) and we can have a discussion there about it. I'm open to revising problems to be clearer as long as the intent of the problem isn't compromised.
